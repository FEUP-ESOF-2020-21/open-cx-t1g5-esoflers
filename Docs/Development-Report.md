## Product Vision

Making virtual connections easy!

<!--A product vision describes the essential of the product and sets the direction to where a product is headed, and what the product will deliver in the future. 

Making virtual connections easy!
Simplify meetups!
Video meetups for all!

**We favor a catchy and concise statement, ideally one sentence.**

## Elevator Pitch

<!--Setting up a virtual meeting is arduous and boring and can be very repetitive and prone to human  errors if there are multiple sessions to be adjourned.  
It's time consuming for hosts and an organizational mess for attendees, who are bombarded with many different links and have to manage several different platforms getting confused in which one each meeting will occur.-->

Video Session Toolkit removes the anxiety from virtual sessions' management.  
Create meetings fast and easily, keep track of your sessions, join sessions easily and using a single app, create a gathering easily, comunicate changes with the audience instantly and much more.

---

## Pre-Requirements

For the usage of the module it is required that the user has a mobile phone with internet connection. It is required to have an account in the application.  
For full funtionality it is reccommended to have notifications enabled.  
Android version=>8.0  
Ios version>=Ios 10.0.0  

---

## Requirements

With Video Session Toolkit participating in interesting sessions at a conference or setting virtual encounters with other participants is easy and practical. With its calendar and video apps integration, there is no hassle in setting up a virtual room or in finding the correct session link. Additionally, a reminder before any meeting will help to be right on time, everytime.

<!--Start by contextualizing your module, describing the main concepts, terms, roles, scope and boundaries of the application domain addressed by the project.-->

### User stories

<!--This section will contain the requirements of the product described as **user stories**, organized in a global **[user story map](https://plan.io/blog/user-story-mapping/)** with **user roles** or **themes**.

For each theme, or role, you may add a small description. User stories should be detailed in the tool you decided to use for project management (e.g. trello or github projects).

A user story is a description of desired functionality told from the perspective of the user or customer. A starting template for the description of a user story is 

*As a < user role >, I want < goal > so that < reason >.*

**INVEST in good user stories**. 
You may add more details after, but the shorter and complete, the better. In order to decide if the user story is good, please follow the [INVEST guidelines](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/).

**User interface mockups**.
After the user story text, you should add a draft of the corresponding user interfaces, a simple mockup or draft, if applicable.

**Acceptance tests**.
For each user story you should write also the acceptance tests (textually in Gherkin), i.e., a description of scenarios (situations) that will help to confirm that the system satisfies the requirements addressed by the user story.

**Value and effort**.
At the end, it is good to add a rough indication of the value of the user story to the customers (e.g. [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method) and the team should add an estimation of the effort to implement it, for example, using t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL).-->

### Domain model

The video Session Toolkit intends to help organize a users schedule and conference links.

* Each session has a start date and hour and a finishing hour. It has a title, a video-chat platform, a room link and can either be public (part of the conference) or private (between people attending).
* The calendar olds the sessions.
* Each user has a profile which olds information about the sessions he'll attend as well as the sessions created with other users (private sessions).

## Architecture and Design

The program follows an MVC approach. The database and its querys are independent of its design and of the rendering. The screens translate into different states of the application and the screen buttons are widgets that redirect application to other states. All querys to the database are asyncronous.

### Logical architecture

Following the MVC approach, we were able to highlight three different components:

- *Model*: that consists of the logical part of the application, that stores and manages the application data.

- *Controller*: this converts actions made by the user to demands to retrieve/update data in the storage/model.

- *View*: represents the visual representation of our application showing the respective data and being manipulated by the controller.

<img src="./tables%20and%20diagrams/logical_architect.png"> 

### Physical architecture

The physical architecture of our project is divided into two parts, which are connected to each other.
The Video Talk Toolkit app must be installed on the user's smartphone, and it will connect with the database via HTTPS request to sync user's profile changes and update local information.
The technologies used in this project were Flutter-Dart as the framework for our mobile application, Graddle for build automation and Firebase server for storage.

![](./tables%20and%20diagrams/physical_architecture.png)

<!--The goal of this subsection is to document the high-level physical structure of the software system (machines, connections, software components installed, and their dependencies) using UML deployment diagrams or component diagrams (separate or integrated), showing the physical structure of the system.

It should describe also the technologies considered and justify the selections made. Examples of technologies relevant for openCX are, for example, frameworks for mobile applications (Flutter vs ReactNative vs ...), languages to program with microbit, and communication with things (beacons, sensors, etc.).-->

### Prototype
<img align="right" src="./prototype.gif" alt="" width="150">  

This prototype reflects some of the major user stories:  

* The login page

* The profile page

* The calendar

* Adding, removing, creating and editting events

* Private and public sessions/meetings  

* Ability to choose the paltform for the meeting

* And the overall usage flow  





<!--To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe in more detail which, and how, user(s) story(ies) were implemented. -->

---

## Implementation

All releases can be found in the [Releases page](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t1g5-esoflers/releases).

---

## Test

The features that require testing are the following:

* [Create a session](#acceptance-tests-1)
* [Add a session to calendar](#acceptance-tests-2)
* [Verify app routes throughout the different screens](#acceptance-tests)

<!-- There are several ways of documenting testing activities, and quality assurance in general, being the most common: a strategy, a plan, test case specifications, and test checklists.

In this section it is only expected to include the following:

* test plan describing the list of features to be tested and the testing methods and tools;
* test case specifications to verify the functionalities, using unit tests and acceptance tests.

A good practice is to simplify this, avoiding repetitions, and automating the testing actions as much as possible. -->

---

## Configuration and change management

The project flow was controlled using github. The github flow was followed having, therefore, a development branch, where the features branches are merged and a master branch where releases are made.

---

## Project management

In order to manage the project's progress, tasks and team, github projects was used. The board can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t1g5-esoflers/projects/1).

<!--Software project management is an art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we expect that each team adopts a project management tool capable of registering tasks, assign tasks to people, add estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Example of tools to do this are:

* [Trello.com](https://trello.com)
* [Github Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/com)
* [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com)
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

We recommend to use the simplest tool that can possibly work for the team.-->
